Item 65: Prefer interfaces to reflection

* java.lang.reflect offers programmatic access to arbitrary classes.
* Given a Class object, you can obtain: Constructor, Method, and Field instances
* Reflection allows one class to use another, however, comes at a price:
    • You lose all the benefits of compile-time type checking
    • The code required to perform reflective access is clumsy and verbose.
    • Performance suffers. [demo] Hello.java
[demo] Example 1
* This example demonstrates two disadvantages of reflection.
  First, the example can generate six different exceptions at runtime, they could be compile-time errors if not use reflection
  Second, 25 lines code(reflection) v.s. 1 line(constructor invocation)

* A legitimate use of reflection is to manage a class’s dependencies on other classes, methods, or fields that may be absent at runtime.

*In summary,
use reflection only to instantiate objects, and access the objects using interface or superclass that is known at compile time.
