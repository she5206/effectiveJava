 * One line is ideal for a lambda, and three lines is a reasonable maximum
 * If you want to create an instance of an abstract class, you can do it with an anonymous class, but not a lambda.
 * In a lambda, the this keyword refers to the enclosing instance
 * In an anonymous class, the this keyword refers to the anonymous class instance
 * In summary, as of Java 8, lambdas are by far the best way to represent small function objects
