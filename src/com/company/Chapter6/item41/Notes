Marker interfaces have two advantages over marker annotations.
1. marker interfaces define a type that is implemented by instances of the marked class;
   marker annotations do not.

2. marker interfaces can be targeted more precisely.

3. marker interfaces are part of the larger annotation facility.

If you want to define a type that does not have any new methods associated with it, a marker interface is the way to go.
If you want to mark program elements other than classes and interfaces or to fit the marker into a framework
that already makes heavy use of annotation types, then a marker annotation is the correct choice.

If you find yourself writing a marker annotation type whose target is ElementType.TYPE,
take the time to figure out whether it really should be an annotation type
or whether a marker interface would be more appropriate.
